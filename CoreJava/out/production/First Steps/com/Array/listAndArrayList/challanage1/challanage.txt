create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities.
able to store modify, remove and query contact names;
you will want to create a separate class for contacts (name and phone number).
create a master class (mobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of contacts
The mobilePhone class has the functionality listed above.
add a menu of options tht are available
Options:  Quit print list of contacts , add new contact, updte exitsing contact , remove contact
and searh /find contact.
when adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exits (use name)
Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the arrayList to mobilePhone
eg- no ints, noget (i) etc
mobilePhone should do everything with contact objects only
